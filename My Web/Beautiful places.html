</br><p>Merat Keshet is the name of a geological attraction on the northern ridge of Nahal Batsat in the Western Galilee , in the area of ​​Adamit Park .
Despite the name of the place, these days it is not a cave - geological processes changed over the years what was a cave, its ceiling collapsed and today it forms a kind of large arch.
Hence the name of the site. The special shape of "Rainbow Cave" attracts many tourists and abseiling enthusiasts .

From Merat Keshet towards the east begins the Nahal Sarach Reserve , with the route (marked in blue) starting along the cliff near Merat Keshet and going down towards the wadi to Einat Karacha at the bottom of the gorge.</p>



<u><h2>The formation of the cave</h2></u>
<p>Cave was created by a karst process in which the rocks gradually dissolve,
the spaces and cracks widen. Chimneys and caves may collapse as seen in the phenomenon of collapse dolines.
The collapse of a cave that served as an underground conduit will create an elongated valley.
 Since the general shape of the cave is like a tube, the collapse will leave a valley whose walls have a negative slope. These cliffs are known as Tsanirim .
What distinguishes the tubes created as a result of the collapse of a karstic lead is their presence on both sides of the valley. Dolomite -type arch cave rocks.</p>

<u><h1>The Dead Sea</h1></u>

</br><p>The Dead Sea is a salt lake with no outlet to the sea, located in the area of ​​the Syrian-African rift and in the center of which runs the border between Israel and Jordan . The concentration of salts in the Dead Sea is 34.2% - ten times higher than the concentration of salts in the Mediterranean Sea . This high concentration is due to the fact that the lake is terminal (the lake's water has no outlet anywhere), and it is located in an area with a hot and dry desert climate characterized by high evaporation rates . The lake is the fourth saltiest body of water in the world
    Until 2019 it was considered the lowest visible land place in the world(This title became one of the names of the Dead Sea), but in 2019 it was discovered that the bottom of the Denman Glacier is the lowest land place in the world - 3,500 meters below sea level. However, this place is covered in ice and therefore today the Dead Sea holds the title of the lowest visible land place in the world.
    Since the second half of the twentieth century, the level of the lake has been constantly decreasing, mainly due to the extensive use of the water sources that flow into it, the most important of which is the Jordan River , and the pumping of water for evaporation in ponds in the south of the basin. The Dead Sea basin consists of two basins, southern and northern. Due to the continuous decrease in the level, the southern part of the lake dried up, which was much shallower than the northern part, and its depth was only about ten meters before the drying process (the bottom of the southern part was 401 meters below sea level). The average depth of its northern part is about 200 meters and its bottom is an average of 730 meters below sea level. With the drying of the southern basin, ponds were built in it for the purpose of evaporating the water and producing potash and other chemicals by the potash plants in Israel and the Jordanian Arab Potash Company . These pools require extensive pumping of the lake water. Pumping the water into the ponds is one of the reasons for the drop in the level. Another influencing factor is an increase in water consumption with regional development in the last decades. Since the construction of the Degania Dam, the operation of the national carrier and the diverting of the Yarmouch water to the Ha'or Canal, dams have been erected on all the large eastern basins for the purpose of capturing water for drinking and irrigation.
    The annual rate of decrease of the sea level in the last decade is a little more than a meter per year . In 2012 the rate increased to about 1.40 meters. The drop in the level caused a significant change in the borders of the lake, and as a result its area decreased by about 35%. The width of the sea in the northern basin of the Dead Sea at the maximum point is 18 kilometers , its length is about 51 kilometers and its area in 2018 was about 590 square kilometers. The cumulative drop in sea level causes major changes in the sea basin including: irreversible changes in the water body in the northern basin, creation of sinkholes , retreat of beaches, damage to infrastructure (roads and bridges) and nature reserves.
    The Dead Sea is very important for industry and tourism. The composition of its water is different from that of ordinary sea water, and includes a high concentration of magnesium , calcium and potassium . This fact is used by the chemical industry in the territories of Israel and Jordan, among other things, to produce potash , magnesium and bromine compounds .
    The landscapes of the Dead Sea basin, the historical importance of the sites located near it, such as Masada , Ein Gedi , Makhvar and Qumran , the special chemical composition of its waters and the special climate that prevails in it - all these have made the Dead Sea a global tourist center , and in particular a center of medical tourism . Thousands of hotel rooms were built in the area, concentrated in Jordan , in the northeastern corner of the lake, and in Israel in Ein Bokek on the shores of the pools in the southern basin. 
    The origin of the name of the Dead Sea is in the Bible, where he is sometimes also mentioned in the names of the seas of the Arabah And the primordial sea.</p>

 </br><p>The Old City of Jerusalem is the ancient urban area of ​​Jerusalem. Its area surrounded by the walls of Jerusalem is about 850 dunams .Also included in the old city are Mount Zion and the City of David , which are outside the walls, nearby and on the south side.
    The old city is divided into 4 quarters: the Muslim quarter , the Jewish quarter , the Christian quarter and the Armenian quarter . Today, about 39,000 people live there. There are eight well-known gates in the Old City wall : the Jaffa Gate , the Shechem Gate , the Zion Gate , the Mercy Gate (closed), the Lions Gate , the Flower Gate , the New Gate , and the Ashpot Gate , and two side gates: the Tanners' Gate , and the Excavation Gate .
    The Old City is a major attraction for tourists of different religions and nationalities, who come from all over the world to visit their sacred sites, including: the Temple Mount , the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher . The old city, in the form and borders we know today, was built in the Ottoman period . However, "the shape of the old city, the structure of its built-up area, its current wall, its gates, its streets, its markets and its quarters, are the product of important periods that preceded it by far.
    "Many of the sites found in the area above and below the level of life, originate from ancient times . 
    The old city is built on the ruins of houses, vaults and debris flows that were built and destroyed alternately over two thousand years. Under many houses there are ancient cisterns and drainage passages. The level of living in the old city nowadays is about 4-8 meters above the street level in the city in the days of the First Temple, and about 2-4 meters above the city level in the Roman period in the first centuries AD.
    In 1981 , the Old City complex was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO .
